# <img src="https://code.google.com/p/google-axs-chrome/logo?cct=1381533215"> Chrome Extensions for Accessibility

These Chrome Extensions are available here so that developers can use them to enhance the accessibility of their products. They allow developers to test their web apps inside the browser so that they can experience their products as users do in order to conduct better accessibility testing.

Furthermore, the code shared by these extensions provides fine-grained access to text content and the DOM of the page, and this code can be used by developers to create innovative access strategies that aren't constrained by traditional accessibility APIs.

### Downloads
All extensions are available as packaged __.crx__ files under the "Downloads" section. You can also [download ChromeVis](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/halnfobaneppemjnonmmhngbfifnafgd) directly from the Chrome Extensions Gallery.

## Dependencies
The ChromeVis extension relies on two third-party libraries, listed below.

* [jscolor](http://jscolor.com) (used in chromevis/options.html)
* [keycode.js](http://jonathan.tang.name/files/js_keycode/apidocs/keycode.html) (used in chromevis/chromeVis_main.js)

Also please note that provided extensions are intended to be used on Chrome and rely on Chrome APIs.
